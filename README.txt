Describtion of assignment 3
the part one of this assignment basically using Luhn's Algorithm to check the validity of credit card number or social security number and so on...
creating a particular variable and assigned inntial value as 0 ,  created a method called cardcheck()  so that i can call the method to execute the output by prompting conditional statement. furthermore, utilizing, bool, for loop and range method aided me to check the number of digit.  particularly , using checksum as a variable in the conditional clause to prompt user for input and get the output  values



Second part, 
again implementing the Luhn's algorithm to write a simple code that can be able to verify the number credit card whether is valid or not. as we learned in the lecture how to compute the this Luhn's algorithm. the driver able to predict whether the credit card number is correct or not. the driver will prompt the user for input , then it will verify for you whether the digit number is valid or invalid.
