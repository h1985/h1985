Describtion of assignment 4
i Calculated the net force (Fx, Fy) at the current time t acting on that particle using Newton's law of gravitation and the principle of superposition.
also computed its acceleration (ax, ay) at time t using the net force computed in Step 1 and Newton's second law of motion: ax = Fx / m, ay = Fy / m.
Calculate its new velocity (vx, vy) at the next time step by using the acceleration computed in Step 2a and the velocity from the old time step: Assuming the acceleration remains constant in this interval, the new velocity is (vx + Δt ax, vy + Δt ay).
i computed its new position (rx, ry) at time t + Δt by using the velocity computed in Step 2b and its old position at time t, but still I'm not getting the right answer and incomplete.
there are bugs i could not able to solve that's why i took a longer to submit the assignment. i will redo  if it's  possible 
i
